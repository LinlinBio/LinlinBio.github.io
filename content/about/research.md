  - title: CCB02 Inhibits Mouse Oocyte Meiosis
    company: National Institute of Biological Sciences
    company_url: http://nibs.ac.cn/en/
    company_logo: org-nibs
    location: Beijing, China

        This study examined the effects of CCB02, a small molecule that binds the CPAP-binding site on tubulin, during mouse oocyte meiosis. We found that CCB02 impairs spindle assembly and delays meiotic progression in a dose-dependent manner, revealing its impact on centrosome-independent spindle organization in oocytes.
