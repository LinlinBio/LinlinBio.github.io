  - title: Paediatric Immune Cell Atlas
    company: University of Queensland
    company_url: https://www.uq.edu.au/
    company_logo: org-uq
    location: Brisbane, Australia
    date_start: '2025-10-01'

        I am currently a visiting research student at the Centre for Childrenâ€™s Health Research, The University of Queensland. My graduation thesis focuses on generating scRNA-seq data from clinical immune cells, combined with computational benchmarking and comparison of different single-cell technologies.

  - title: CCB02 Inhibits Mouse Oocyte Meiosis
    company: National Institute of Biological Sciences
    company_url: http://nibs.ac.cn/en/
    company_logo: org-nibs
    location: Beijing, China
    date_start: '2025-07-01'
    date_end: '2025-08-01'
    description: |2-
        This study examined the effects of CCB02, a small molecule that binds the CPAP-binding site on tubulin, during mouse oocyte meiosis. We found that CCB02 impairs spindle assembly and delays meiotic progression in a dose-dependent manner, revealing its impact on centrosome-independent spindle organization in oocytes.

  - title: Perfecting Genetic Code Expansion (GCE) Technique
    company: Wuhan University
    company_url: https://en.whu.edu.cn/
    company_logo: org-whu
    location: Wuhan, China
    date_start: '2024-09-01'
    date_end: '2025-06-01'
    description: |2-
        This study develops a novel eukaryotic expression system that selectively eliminates truncated proteins arising from genetic code expansion (GCE) while preserving full-length products. By integrating an N-terminal degron, a C-terminal localization tag, and a split TEV protease, the system increases full-length protein yield by 1.4-fold, reduces truncations by 4.6-fold, and can be tuned via small molecules or alternative localization signals, thereby enhancing the efficiency of GCE for protein engineering and live-cell imaging.

  - title: Imperfect Ant-mimicry in a Wolf Spider Species

        This study investigates how the wolf spider *Arctosa kiangsiensis* changes its ant-mimicking behavior across development. Juveniles mimic small ants (*Pristomyrmex punctatus*), while adults mimic larger ants (*Formica cunicularia*). Using locomotion tracking, visual modeling, and predation assays with chicks, we show that spiders closely match the movement and appearance of co-occurring ants in a stage-specific manner. This integrated strategyâ€”including locomotor mimicry, transformational mimicry, and background camouflageâ€”reduces predation risk and enhances survival, revealing a sophisticated ontogenetic anti-predator adaptation.
